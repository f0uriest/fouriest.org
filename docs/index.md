# Hello

My name is Rory Conlin and I work on physics and math and engineering and stuff, mostly
in the realm of plasma physics and nuclear fusion.

I'm currently in the [stellarator group](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~mattland/) at University of Maryland, before that I did my PhD at Princeton in the [Plasma Control Group](https://control.princeton.edu/)

My research is a combination of plasma physics, optimization, numerical methods and machine learning. I'm one of the main authors of the [DESC code](https://github.com/PlasmaControl/DESC) for stellarator optimization, as well as a number of packages in the JAX ecosystem including

- [interpax](https://github.com/f0uriest/interpax) for interpolation
- [quadax](https://github.com/f0uriest/quadax) for numerical quadrature
- [orthax](https://github.com/f0uriest/orthax) for working with orthogonal polynomials

You can find me on [github](https://github.com/f0uriest) or via [mail@fouriest.org](mailto:mail@fouriest.org)
